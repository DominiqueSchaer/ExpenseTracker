# What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.  
It is designed for building RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently, with automatic data validation, interactive documentation, and high performance powered by Starlette and Pydantic.

**Key features:**
- Automatic OpenAPI and interactive docs (Swagger UI, ReDoc)
- Data validation and serialization using Python type hints and Pydantic
- Asynchronous support (async/await)
- High performance (comparable to Node.js and Go)
- Easy integration with modern Python tooling
